### uncle bobs three rules of TDD

[reference](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html)

- write no production code except to pass a failing unit test
- write only enough of a test to demostrate a failure, this include compilation errors
- write only enough production code to make a test pass

You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
Refactor.
